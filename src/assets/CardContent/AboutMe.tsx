        My name is Adrian Ye! Hello nice to meet you :D
        <p/>
        <img src="src/assets/img/hes all in.jpg"></img>
        <p>I am a recent Graduate from UC San Diego :picture of me: with a B.S. in Computer Science!</p>
        <p>I believe in having honest, open, and direct communication. I am not afraid to be wrong and value the input of others greatly.</p>
        <p>This does not mean I am a pushover. I am not a yes man.</p>

        <p>Learning about new subjects and asking people questions about what they love is one of my great joys, and I genuienly take interest, no matter how corny that sounds</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>I have a big interest in gadgets and whatnots and having deep conversations... lol? </p>
        <p/>
        <p>I love one piece! I love gaming, and in particular Pikmin, overwatch, Balatro especially, and more! </p>
